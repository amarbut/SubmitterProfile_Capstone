# SubmitterProfile_Capstone
Repository for all code related to this project

## LaTeX_Files
Includes all files necessary to create the .pdf from the .tex file. Capstone_Paper.pdf is the current draft of the final deliverable for this project.

## Descriptive Stats.R
This is the R-code used to perform all of the descriptive stats

## FormBasedSegmentation.py
This is python code, mostly from a project done for Fall '18. Here I attempted to segment users via k-means clustering based only on which opportunities they had submitted to. The algorithm worked, but failed to produce meaningful/cohesive results.
